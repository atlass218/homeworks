/*
What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it
impact the way variables are used?

Dart to be a statically-typed language means that each variable
has a specific data type (like int, String, double) that is known
 and checked at compile-time, preventing you from assigning the wrong
  type of data (e.g., a string to an integer variable) and catching
   many bugs before the code even runs

  print("Dart is a statically-typed language means that each variable has a specific datatype,\nand the compiler checks the code before to be run preventing the programmer\nto assign the wrong datatype to variable");
