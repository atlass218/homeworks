Food Delivery App – Orders & Menu
      Imagine you are building a food delivery app.
      - The app has a menu of food items (each with a name, price, and category
        like "Pizza" or "Drinks").
      - A user can add multiple items to an order.
      - The app should calculate the total price of the order.
